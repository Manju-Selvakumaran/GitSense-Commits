# Activity Summary for 2/15/2026

## 3:31:15 PM
The provided log details the development of a protein function classifier project, focusing on data handling, feature extraction, and model training. The timestamps range from February 14, 2026, 2:53 PM to 4:17 PM.

**File-specific updates and significant timestamps:**

*   **`c:\Users\manju\Documents\protein-function-classifier\src\data_loader.py`** (First significant change: 2/14/2026, 2:53:48 PM)
    This module is responsible for fetching, cleaning, and loading protein sequence data from UniProt.
    *   It defines `fetch_uniprot_enzymes` to query UniProt for enzyme sequences based on EC class, handling pagination and TSV format.
    *   `fetch_all_ec_classes` orchestrates fetching data for all seven EC classes, combines them into a single DataFrame, and saves the raw data to `data/raw/uniprot_enzymes.csv`.
    *   `clean_dataset` preprocesses the fetched data by renaming columns, removing missing sequences, dropping duplicates, converting length to numeric, filtering by sequence length (50-2000), and ensuring only standard amino acids are present.
    *   `load_dataset` facilitates loading the cleaned dataset.
    *   `get_dataset_summary` provides descriptive statistics of the loaded dataset, including total sequences, unique organisms, class distribution, and sequence length statistics.

*   **`c:\Users\manju\Documents\protein-function-classifier\test_setup.py`** (First significant change: 2/14/2026, 2:55:48 PM)
    This script is designed to verify the project's setup and environment.
    *   `test_imports` checks if essential Python packages like `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `xgboost`, `requests`, `tqdm`, and `streamlit` are installed.
    *   `test_project_structure` verifies the existence of required directories (e.g., `data`, `src`, `models`, `notebooks`) and critical files (e.g., `src/data_loader.py`, `requirements.txt`).
    *   `test_data_loader` performs a basic test of the `data_loader` module by attempting to fetch a small number of sequences from the UniProt API to confirm connectivity and functionality.
    *   The `main` function aggregates and reports the results of these setup tests.

*   **`c:\Users\manju\Documents\protein-function-classifier\src\features.py`** (First significant change: 2/14/2026, 3:53:09 PM)
    This module is dedicated to extracting various features from protein sequences for machine learning classification.
    *   It defines constants for standard amino acids and their physicochemical properties (hydrophobicity, molecular weight, polarity, charge, helix/sheet propensity).
    *   Functions like `compute_amino_acid_composition` (20 features), `compute_dipeptide_composition` (400 features), `compute_physicochemical_properties` (10 features), `compute_secondary_structure_propensity` (4 features), and `compute_sequence_complexity` (3 features) are implemented to derive different types of sequence information.
    *   `extract_all_features` combines the outputs of these individual functions, resulting in a total of 437 features per protein sequence.
    *   A `get_feature_names` function is partially defined to provide descriptive names for the extracted features.

*   **`c:\Users\manju\Documents\protein-function-classifier\src\model.py`**
    This module handles the training, evaluation, and persistence of machine learning models for enzyme classification.
    *   **Initial version** (2/14/2026, 4:03:48 PM):
        *   Sets up EC class names.
        *   Includes functions to `load_data` (from `.npy` files), `prepare_data` (splitting and `StandardScaler` for feature scaling), and `get_models` (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting).
        *   Provides `evaluate_model` for training and basic metric reporting, `cross_validate_model` for K-fold cross-validation, and `train_all_models` to run all defined models.
        *   `get_feature_importance` extracts importance for tree-based models.
        *   `save_model` and `load_model` utilize `joblib` for model and scaler persistence.
        *   `print_classification_report` and `compare_models` aid in result analysis.
    *   **Major update** (2/14/2026, 4:14:42 PM):
        *   Introduced `LabelEncoder` for label preprocessing, explicitly encoding target labels to start from 0. This change was made to ensure compatibility, especially with XGBoost, and the `label_encoder` is now stored alongside the model and scaler.
        *   The `prepare_data` function was updated to use `LabelEncoder` and include it in its return value.
        *   XGBoost parameters in `get_models` were adjusted to `use_label_encoder=False` and `eval_metric='mlogloss'`.
        *   `save_model` and `load_model` were extended to handle the `LabelEncoder` object.
        *   `print_classification_report` was enhanced to use the `label_encoder` to map encoded predictions back to their original EC class names for more readable reports.

**Patterns and recurring elements:**

*   **Modular Project Structure:** The codebase is organized into distinct modules (`data_loader`, `features`, `model`) reflecting a standard machine learning pipeline.
*   **Data Handling:** `pandas` and `numpy` are consistently used across modules for data manipulation and numerical operations.
*   **Logging and Feedback:** There is a strong emphasis on printing progress and status messages to the console using f-strings, often wrapped with separator lines (e.g., `print("=" * 50)`).
*   **Common ML Libraries:** Reliance on `sklearn` for model selection, preprocessing, and metrics, along with `xgboost` for powerful gradient boosting.
*   **Persistence:** `joblib` is used to save and load trained models, scalers, and label encoders, indicating a focus on reproducible and deployable models.
*   **Timestamp Repetition:** Several files appear multiple times in the log with identical content but different timestamps, suggesting frequent saves without functional code changes during development. Actual content changes are sparse and significant when they occur.

### File-Specific Updates and Significant Timestamps:

*   **`c:\Users\manju\Documents\protein-function-classifier\src\data_loader.py`** (Initial versions logged at `2/14/2026, 2:53:48 PM` and `2:54:36 PM`): This module is responsible for fetching protein sequences, specifically enzymes with EC (Enzyme Commission) annotations, from UniProt. Key functions include `fetch_uniprot_enzymes` for a specific EC class, `fetch_all_ec_classes` to get data for all 7 classes, and `clean_dataset` which handles data preprocessing steps like renaming columns, removing missing values, duplicates, and sequences outside a length range (50-2000 amino acids), and filtering for standard amino acids. It also provides utilities to load and summarize the dataset. No functional changes observed between the two logged timestamps.

*   **`c:\Users\manju\Documents\protein-function-classifier\test_setup.py`** (Initial versions logged at `2/14/2026, 2:55:48 PM` and `2:57:24 PM`): This script provides a quick way to verify the project's setup. It includes tests for:
    *   **Package Imports:** Ensures necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn, requests, tqdm, streamlit) are installed.
    *   **Project Structure:** Checks for the existence of required directories (`data`, `notebooks`, `src`, `models`, `figures`) and core files (`src/__init__.py`, `src/data_loader.py`, `requirements.txt`).
    *   **Data Loader Functionality:** Verifies that the `data_loader` module can be imported and can successfully fetch a small number of sequences from the UniProt API. No functional changes observed between the two logged timestamps.

*   **`c:\Users\manju\Documents\protein-function-classifier\src\features.py`** (Initial versions logged at `2/14/2026, 3:53:09 PM` and `3:53:17 PM`): This module focuses on extracting features from protein sequences for enzyme classification. It defines standard amino acids and various physicochemical properties (hydrophobicity, molecular weight, polarity, charge, secondary structure propensity). It contains functions to compute:
    *   Amino acid composition (20 features)
    *   Dipeptide composition (400 features)
    *   Global physicochemical properties (10 features)
    *   Secondary structure propensity (4 features)
    *   Sequence complexity (3 features).
    The `extract_all_features` function combines these into a total of 437 features. No functional changes observed between the two logged timestamps.

*   **`c:\Users\manju\Documents\protein-function-classifier\src\model.py`** (Multiple logs between `2/14/2026, 4:03:48 PM` and `4:17:54 PM`):
    *   The file initially contains functions for loading data, preparing it (splitting, scaling), defining various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting), evaluating them, performing cross-validation, and saving/loading models.
    *   A significant update occurred at **`2/14/2026, 4:14:42 PM`**. This change introduced `LabelEncoder` from `sklearn.preprocessing` to encode target labels (EC classes) to start from 0, which is often required for models like XGBoost. The `prepare_data` function was updated to perform this encoding and return the `label_encoder`. The `XGBoost` model parameters in `get_models` were adjusted (`use_label_encoder=False`, `eval_metric='mlogloss'`). The `save_model` and `load_model` functions were extended to handle the persistence of the `label_encoder` object, and `print_classification_report` was modified to use the encoder to map encoded labels back to original EC numbers for more readable reports. No further functional changes observed in subsequent logs for this file (`4:17:49 PM`, `4:17:54 PM`).

*   **`c:\Users\manju\Documents\protein-function-classifier\app.py`** (Introduced at **`2/15/2026, 6:51:39 PM`**): This file implements the Streamlit web application. It loads the trained model, scaler, and label encoder. It provides functions to `validate_sequence` (checking for valid amino acids and length constraints) and `predict_function` (extracting features, scaling, and predicting the EC class along with probabilities). The Streamlit UI allows users to input protein sequences (or use sample sequences) and displays prediction results, including confidence scores and descriptions of each EC class.

*   **`c:\Users\manju\Documents\protein-function-classifier\.gitignore`** (Introduced at **`2/15/2026, 6:56:13 PM`**): This file specifies patterns for files and directories to be ignored by Git. It includes virtual environments, Python cache files, Jupyter notebooks checkpoints, large data files (CSV, NPY), IDE-specific configurations, OS-generated files, and log files.

*   **`c:\Users\manju\Documents\protein-function-classifier\README.md`** (Multiple logs between `2/15/2026, 6:59:48 PM` and `7:02:52 PM`):
    *   Initially (up to `2/15/2026, 7:00:27 PM`), the README provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including its purpose, results (XGBoost as best model with 60.2% accuracy), details of the 437 extracted features, quick start instructions, project structure, model comparison table, technologies used, dataset information, future improvements, license, and author placeholders.
    *   Minor updates occurred between **`2/15/2026, 7:00:57 PM` and `7:02:52 PM`**, where the author's GitHub link was refined and a LinkedIn profile link was added. The `git clone` command in the Quick Start section was also updated to point to the correct GitHub repository (`https://github.com/Manju-Selvakumaran/protein-function-classifier.git`).

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Protein Function Classification Focus:** The entire project revolves around classifying protein function into 7 enzyme commission (EC) classes using amino acid sequences.
*   **Structured ML Workflow:** The code follows a clear machine learning pipeline:
    1.  **Data Acquisition and Cleaning:** `data_loader.py` handles fetching from UniProt and initial cleaning.
    2.  **Feature Engineering:** `features.py` extracts various sequence-based features.
    3.  **Model Training and Evaluation:** `model.py` covers splitting data, scaling, training multiple models, cross-validation, and performance reporting.
    4.  **Deployment:** `app.py` provides a Streamlit interface for practical use.
*   **XGBoost as Optimal Model:** XGBoost is consistently highlighted as the best-performing model, with specific configuration updates in `model.py` for better compatibility and performance.
*   **Persistence with `joblib`:** Models, scalers, and label encoders are consistently saved and loaded using `joblib` for efficient storage and retrieval.
*   **Streamlit Integration:** The project culminates in a Streamlit web application (`app.py`), indicating a focus on practical deployment and user interaction.
*   **Detailed Documentation:** All Python files include extensive docstrings, explaining the purpose of modules, functions, parameters, and returns, contributing to code clarity and maintainability.
*   **Redundant Log Entries:** A noticeable pattern is the presence of consecutive log entries for the same file showing identical code content, especially for `data_loader.py`, `test_setup.py`, `features.py`, and the initial `model.py` and `README.md` entries. This suggests frequent saves or automated formatting operations without substantive code changes.
