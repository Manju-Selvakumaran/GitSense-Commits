# Activity Summary for 2/14/2026

## 3:15:10 PM
The project primarily involves a data loader module and a setup test script, with all recorded activity occurring on February 14, 2026, between 2:53 PM and 2:57 PM.

For the file `c:\Users\manju\Documents\protein-function-classifier\src\data_loader.py`, logged at 2:53:48 PM and again at 2:54:36 PM with identical content, the module is designed for fetching, processing, and summarizing protein sequence data from UniProt. Key functionalities include:
*   `fetch_uniprot_enzymes`: Retrieves protein sequences for a specified EC (Enzyme Commission) class from the UniProt API, handling pagination and fetching a limited number of reviewed entries.
*   `fetch_all_ec_classes`: Orchestrates the fetching process for all 7 EC classes, saving the combined and cleaned dataset to `data/raw/uniprot_enzymes.csv`.
*   `clean_dataset`: Preprocesses the fetched data by renaming columns, removing missing sequences and duplicates, converting sequence length to numeric, filtering sequences by length (50-2000 amino acids), and ensuring only standard amino acids are present.
*   `load_dataset`: Provides a utility to load the preprocessed dataset from disk.
*   `get_dataset_summary`: Generates a summary of the dataset, including total sequences, unique organisms, class distribution, and sequence length statistics.
The module relies on `requests` for API calls, `pandas` for data manipulation, `time` for pauses, `os` for path operations, and `tqdm` for progress bars.

The file `c:\Users\manju\Documents\protein-function-classifier\test_setup.py`, logged at 2:55:48 PM and again at 2:57:24 PM with identical content, serves as a verification script for the project environment. It includes tests for:
*   `test_imports`: Checks the installation of essential Python packages such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `xgboost`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `requests`, `tqdm`, and `streamlit`.
*   `test_project_structure`: Verifies the existence of required directories (e.g., `data`, `data/raw`, `src`, `models`) and key files (e.g., `src/data_loader.py`, `requirements.txt`), ensuring the project layout is correct.
*   `test_data_loader`: Imports and performs a basic test of the `fetch_uniprot_enzymes` function from `src.data_loader` to confirm the UniProt API connection and data fetching capability.
The script consolidates these tests, provides a summary of pass/fail status, and suggests next steps for data download if all tests pass.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
All logged activities occurred on February 14, 2026.
*   The `data_loader.py` module was in its current state at 2:53:48 PM, with a subsequent log at 2:54:36 PM showing no modifications.
*   The `test_setup.py` script was in its current state at 2:55:48 PM, with a subsequent log at 2:57:24 PM also showing no modifications.
The log indicates that within these brief time windows, the content of these files remained stable, suggesting either rapid development followed by file saves or logs capturing read events rather than active changes during the recorded intervals.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Project Focus:** Both files are integral to a "protein-function-classifier" project, indicating a clear goal of processing and analyzing protein data.
*   **Data Handling:** `pandas` is a central library, used extensively in `data_loader.py` for data manipulation and implicitly tested in `test_setup.py`.
*   **External API Interaction:** The UniProt REST API is the primary data source, accessed via `requests` in `data_loader.py` and validated by `test_setup.py`.
*   **Structured Output and Feedback:** Both modules employ extensive `print` statements to provide progress updates, status messages, and summaries to the user, enhancing script usability and debuggability.
*   **Modular Design:** The project shows a modular structure with dedicated files for data loading/processing and setup testing, reflecting good software engineering practices.
*   **Consistent File Content:** A recurring pattern in the log is that successive entries for the *same file* within a short timeframe show identical code, implying that no changes were committed or saved between those specific timestamps.

## 5:53:13 PM
The code changes log details the development of a "protein-function-classifier" project, with all recorded modifications occurring on February 14, 2026, primarily in the afternoon. The updates reflect a structured approach to building a machine learning pipeline, covering data acquisition, project setup verification, feature engineering, and model training.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\manju\Documents\protein-function-classifier\src\data_loader.py` (Timestamps: 2/14/2026, 2:53:48 PM and 2:54:36 PM):**
    This file remained unchanged between the two timestamps. It is responsible for fetching protein enzyme sequences and their EC (Enzyme Commission) annotations from UniProt. Key functionalities include:
    *   `fetch_uniprot_enzymes`: Retrieves sequences for a specific EC class, handling pagination and progress display using `tqdm`.
    *   `fetch_all_ec_classes`: Orchestrates the download of enzyme sequences for all seven EC classes and saves the combined data to `data/raw/uniprot_enzymes.csv`.
    *   `clean_dataset`: Preprocesses the raw data by renaming columns, removing missing sequences and duplicates, filtering by sequence length (50-2000 amino acids), and ensuring only standard amino acids are present.
    *   `load_dataset`: Loads the saved dataset from disk.
    *   `get_dataset_summary`: Provides a summary of the dataset, including total sequences, unique organisms, class distribution, and sequence length statistics.

*   **`c:\Users\manju\Documents\protein-function-classifier\test_setup.py` (Timestamps: 2/14/2026, 2:55:48 PM and 2:57:24 PM):**
    This script also remained unchanged between its two timestamps. It serves as a verification tool for the project's setup:
    *   `test_imports`: Checks for the presence of essential Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, sklearn, xgboost, requests, tqdm, streamlit).
    *   `test_project_structure`: Ensures that the required directories (`data`, `data/raw`, `data/processed`, `notebooks`, `src`, `models`, `figures`) and core files (`src/__init__.py`, `src/data_loader.py`, `requirements.txt`) exist.
    *   `test_data_loader`: Verifies the functionality of the `data_loader` module by attempting a small API call to fetch protein sequences.
    *   The `main` function runs all tests and provides a comprehensive summary of the setup status.

*   **`c:\Users\manju\Documents\protein-function-classifier\src\features.py` (Timestamps: 2/14/2026, 3:53:09 PM and 3:53:17 PM):**
    This file was identical across its two timestamps (though the `get_feature_names` function was truncated in the provided log). It focuses on extracting various features from protein sequences for machine learning:
    *   Defines constants for standard amino acids and their physicochemical properties (hydrophobicity, molecular weight, polarity, charge) and secondary structure propensities.
    *   `compute_amino_acid_composition`: Calculates the frequency of each of the 20 standard amino acids.
    *   `compute_dipeptide_composition`: Calculates the frequency of all 400 possible dipeptide pairs.
    *   `compute_physicochemical_properties`: Derives 10 global properties like average hydrophobicity, total molecular weight, and fractions of polar/charged residues.
    *   `compute_secondary_structure_propensity`: Calculates features based on helix and sheet propensities.
    *   `compute_sequence_complexity`: Extracts features such as unique amino acid count, Shannon entropy, and repetitiveness.
    *   `extract_all_features`: Combines all the above into a total of 437 features per protein sequence.

*   **`c:\Users\manju\Documents\protein-function-classifier\src\model.py` (Timestamps: 2/14/2026, 4:03:48 PM, 4:04:34 PM, 4:04:39 PM, 4:14:42 PM, 4:17:49 PM, 4:17:54 PM):**
    This file saw the most significant changes, particularly around **4:14:42 PM**.
    *   **Initial versions (up to 4:04:39 PM)** established a module for training and evaluating various classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting). It included functions for data loading, splitting and scaling (`StandardScaler`), model evaluation with various metrics (accuracy, F1, precision, recall), cross-validation, feature importance extraction, and model persistence using `joblib`. It also had utilities for printing classification reports and comparing models.
    *   **Significant Update (4:14:42 PM, followed by minor saves at 4:17:49 PM and 4:17:54 PM)**:
        *   Introduced `LabelEncoder` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.
        *   The `prepare_data` function was updated to encode target labels (`y`) to start from 0, explicitly stating this as a requirement for `XGBoost` compatibility. The `LabelEncoder` object itself is now returned.
        *   The `XGBClassifier` in `get_models` was configured with `use_label_encoder=False` and `eval_metric='mlogloss'` to align with the new label encoding and suppress deprecation warnings.
        *   `save_model` and `load_model` functions were extended to also persist and retrieve the `LabelEncoder` object, ensuring consistent decoding of predictions.
        *   The `print_classification_report` function was enhanced to accept the `label_encoder`, allowing it to map the encoded predictions back to their original EC class names for a more human-readable report.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Timeliness**: All changes are concentrated on a single day, indicating focused development efforts within a few hours. The very close timestamps for `data_loader.py`, `test_setup.py`, and `model.py` suggest rapid iterations, frequent saving, or minor modifications between recorded states.
*   **Modular Architecture**: The project is clearly structured with dedicated Python files for distinct concerns: data handling (`data_loader.py`), feature engineering (`features.py`), and machine learning (`model.py`).
*   **Standard ML Workflow**: The `model.py` demonstrates a typical supervised machine learning workflow, including data loading, preprocessing (scaling, label encoding), model selection (various ensemble and linear models), training, evaluation (multiple metrics), and persistence.
*   **Tooling**: Consistent use of `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation, `sklearn` for core ML utilities (splitting, scaling, metrics, models), `xgboost` for advanced boosting, `requests` for API calls, `tqdm` for progress bars, and `joblib` for model serialization.
*   **Explanatory Outputs**: Extensive use of `print` statements throughout the modules provides informative feedback on progress, data dimensions, and test results, aiding in debugging and user understanding.
*   **Label Encoding Evolution**: A clear pattern emerged in `model.py` to specifically address label encoding requirements for models like `XGBoost`, ensuring robustness and correct interpretation of multi-class classification results by saving and loading the `LabelEncoder`.
