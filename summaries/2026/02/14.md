# Activity Summary for 2/14/2026

## 3:15:10 PM
The project primarily involves a data loader module and a setup test script, with all recorded activity occurring on February 14, 2026, between 2:53 PM and 2:57 PM.

For the file `c:\Users\manju\Documents\protein-function-classifier\src\data_loader.py`, logged at 2:53:48 PM and again at 2:54:36 PM with identical content, the module is designed for fetching, processing, and summarizing protein sequence data from UniProt. Key functionalities include:
*   `fetch_uniprot_enzymes`: Retrieves protein sequences for a specified EC (Enzyme Commission) class from the UniProt API, handling pagination and fetching a limited number of reviewed entries.
*   `fetch_all_ec_classes`: Orchestrates the fetching process for all 7 EC classes, saving the combined and cleaned dataset to `data/raw/uniprot_enzymes.csv`.
*   `clean_dataset`: Preprocesses the fetched data by renaming columns, removing missing sequences and duplicates, converting sequence length to numeric, filtering sequences by length (50-2000 amino acids), and ensuring only standard amino acids are present.
*   `load_dataset`: Provides a utility to load the preprocessed dataset from disk.
*   `get_dataset_summary`: Generates a summary of the dataset, including total sequences, unique organisms, class distribution, and sequence length statistics.
The module relies on `requests` for API calls, `pandas` for data manipulation, `time` for pauses, `os` for path operations, and `tqdm` for progress bars.

The file `c:\Users\manju\Documents\protein-function-classifier\test_setup.py`, logged at 2:55:48 PM and again at 2:57:24 PM with identical content, serves as a verification script for the project environment. It includes tests for:
*   `test_imports`: Checks the installation of essential Python packages such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `xgboost`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `requests`, `tqdm`, and `streamlit`.
*   `test_project_structure`: Verifies the existence of required directories (e.g., `data`, `data/raw`, `src`, `models`) and key files (e.g., `src/data_loader.py`, `requirements.txt`), ensuring the project layout is correct.
*   `test_data_loader`: Imports and performs a basic test of the `fetch_uniprot_enzymes` function from `src.data_loader` to confirm the UniProt API connection and data fetching capability.
The script consolidates these tests, provides a summary of pass/fail status, and suggests next steps for data download if all tests pass.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
All logged activities occurred on February 14, 2026.
*   The `data_loader.py` module was in its current state at 2:53:48 PM, with a subsequent log at 2:54:36 PM showing no modifications.
*   The `test_setup.py` script was in its current state at 2:55:48 PM, with a subsequent log at 2:57:24 PM also showing no modifications.
The log indicates that within these brief time windows, the content of these files remained stable, suggesting either rapid development followed by file saves or logs capturing read events rather than active changes during the recorded intervals.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Project Focus:** Both files are integral to a "protein-function-classifier" project, indicating a clear goal of processing and analyzing protein data.
*   **Data Handling:** `pandas` is a central library, used extensively in `data_loader.py` for data manipulation and implicitly tested in `test_setup.py`.
*   **External API Interaction:** The UniProt REST API is the primary data source, accessed via `requests` in `data_loader.py` and validated by `test_setup.py`.
*   **Structured Output and Feedback:** Both modules employ extensive `print` statements to provide progress updates, status messages, and summaries to the user, enhancing script usability and debuggability.
*   **Modular Design:** The project shows a modular structure with dedicated files for data loading/processing and setup testing, reflecting good software engineering practices.
*   **Consistent File Content:** A recurring pattern in the log is that successive entries for the *same file* within a short timeframe show identical code, implying that no changes were committed or saved between those specific timestamps.
